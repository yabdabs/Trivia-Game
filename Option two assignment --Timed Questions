Option two assignment --Timed Questions

 or, create an object for each question, as well as answers for each question
	-setquestion function like starwars game?
-create an array of objects, with each object holding a question as well as the answers
	-var currentQuestion will hold the position of the questions array.
	-current question starts at 0
	-var current answer will hold the position of the answer array???

	var questions=[
		question1{
			question: String,
			answer: [answer1, answer2, answer3, answer4]
		},
		question2{
			question: String,
			answer: [answer1, answer2, answer3, answer4]
		},
		question3{
			question: String,
			answer: [answer1, answer2, answer3, answer4]
		}
	]
displayQuestion(){
	this will access the current question from the array based on the question counter variable
}
create startTrivia(){	

	- var next= setInterval(afunction, 30 seconds)
}

-once user clicks start, start the first questions/game function starts
	-Displays only one question until the player answers it correctly or the time runs out
	-displayQuestion function
	-create the form based on the current question as well as the answers using jquery and append it to the respective divs on the page

-if the answer is correct show a congragulations screen, and after a couple of seconds, display the next question
	-

-if the answer is incorrect
	-page shows up telling user the answer is wrong and display the correct answer
-if the time runs out
	-page shows up telling user they ran out of time and display the correct answer

-Final screen shows stats
	-number answered correctly
	-number answered incorrectly
	-option to restart the page(without reloading the answer)
-create a function for next question?
	-this will populate the html with everything in the respective question(either object of arrays or object questions)
	-this will happen once the time runs out, or once the user chooses an answer
	-so you will need a way to access the questions as well as the answers

on start trivia game{
	use setInterval(decrement, 1000)
}

once time==0 or all answers are done{
	clearInterval();
	count= original number;
}

time= amount of seconds to start at
	-use count function for set interval and increment time
	-activity 10 week 3
convertedTime
	-create converted time function
	-pass in current time into converted time(as arguement)
		-this will convert the time
		-use activity 10 week3
